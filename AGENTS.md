## Svelte

You **MUST** use the Svelte 5 API unless explicitly tasked to write Svelte 4 syntax.

### $derived

- `$derived` computes reactive values based on dependencies. For example:

```svelte
<script>
  let count = $state(0);
  let doubled = $derived(count * 2);
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>{doubled}</button>
```

- Do **NOT** introduce side effects in derived expressions; instead, keep them pure.  
  _In Svelte 4 you used `$:` for this, e.g. `$: doubled = count * 2;`, now use the $derived rune instead, e.g `let doubled = $derived(count * 2);`._

#### $derived.by

- Use `$derived.by` for multi-line or complex logic. For example:

```svelte
<script>
  let numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]);
  let total = $derived.by(() => {
    let sum = 0;
    for (const n of numbers) sum += n;
    return sum;
  });
</script>
```

- Do **NOT** force complex logic into a single expression; instead, use `$derived.by` to keep code clear.

#### Overriding derived values

- You can reassign a derived value for features like optimistic UI. It will go back to the `$derived` value once an update in its dependencies happen. For example:

```svelte
<script>
  let post = $props().post;
  let likes = $derived(post.likes);
  async function onclick() {
    likes += 1;
    try {
      await post.like();
    } catch {
      likes -= 1;
    }
  }
</script>
```

- Do **NOT** try to override derived state via effects; instead, reassign directly when needed.  
  _In Svelte 4 you could use `$:` for that, e.g. `$: likes = post.likes; likes = 1`, now use the `$derived` instead, e.g. `let likes = $derived(post.likes); likes = 1;`._
